We believe restricting player access to heroes could be destructive to game design, so it's something we plan to avoid.", "Each time you complete a matchmaking game, you will be rewarded with Battle Points. Earn enough of them, and your profile's Battle Level will increase, at which point you'll receive a new item.", "We're acutely aware of the community's concerns around remaining true to the theme of the game, so much so that we think the community should be directly involved in the process of choosing what goes into it. The Steam Workshop allows you to submit your votes and thoughts on contributed items before we make any decision to put them into the game, so jump in and help us stay on the right track. We think the community at large is actually really good at making these kinds of decisions.",
        "All the items in the store are cosmetic, and don't affect gameplay. In addition, we have plans for how the Dota economy can directly contribute to professional players.", "We don't really think of Dota 2 as a beta, but we also aren't ready for everyone to show up and start playing just yet. We are constantly updating the game with new heroes, bug fixes, and new features.

We (Valve and the Dota community) will be building lots of interesting things in the coming years, and learning every step of the way.

Right now we're working on expanding our server infrastructure, which is the primary bottleneck.", "Similar to how we're approaching the problem of players leaving games early, we have a number of ideas to experiment with to prevent players making life hard for new players in this way. We know this is one of the big challenges we have to solve with a Free to Play game.",
        "Lots of players improve from one season to the next and the purpose of the seasonal reset is to give players a fresh start. Additionally, each season comes with a new set of design changes and players that adapt the best tend to rise to the top. The reset helps distinguish between who can keep up and who can’t.","You’ll play 10 placement matches and, at the end, be seeded into a league and tier.", "Seeding is what happens after your 10th game of the season. Based on a combination of your performance during placement matches and your performance from previous seasons, you’ll be placed in a league and tier. That’s your starting point for the season, but you can climb the ladder quickly by consistently winning games.", "We use some fancy math and statistics to take your progress from previous seasons into account when you’re placed, but you’ll likely be seeded into a different tier or division than the previous season.",
        "Most players will be placed close to where they were in the previous season, but some will be placed lower (or higher) than in the previous season based on their game history. For example, a player who was division V and lost a lot of games at 0 LP last season will see those losses reflected in their placement this season. If a player is placed into a league below their skill level and they start winning, they’ll see accelerated gains / division skipping as the system quickly pushes them to their correct league position.","If you’re just starting ranked play, you’ll be placed at what’s considered the league average. Your performance in your placement matches will determine your standing in relation to other ranked players and, after 10 games, you’ll be seeded to that position for the ranked season.", "The League Championship Series is a professional sports league, with players who compete for most of the year, live with their teams and travel extensively. All this adds up to a full-time job and commitment that requires significant sacrifice and lot of maturity. That’s why we believe that 17 is the appropriate minimum age for a pro player.",

To do so, we pass it into mongoose.model(modelName, schema)","Instances of Models are documents. Documents have many of their own built-in instance methods. We may also define our own custom document instance methods too.","MongoDB supports secondary indexes. With mongoose, we define these indexes within our Schema at the path level or the schema level. Defining indexes at the schema level is necessary when creating compound indexes.",
        "When your application starts up, Mongoose automatically calls ensureIndex for each defined index in your schema. Mongoose will call ensureIndex for each index sequentially, and emit an 'index' event on the model when all the ensureIndex calls succeeded or when there was an error. While nice for development, it is recommended this behavior be disabled in production since index creation can cause a significant performance impact. Disable the behavior by setting the autoIndex option of your schema to false, or globally on the connection by setting the option config.autoIndex to false.","Virtuals are document properties that you can get and set but that do not get persisted to MongoDB. The getters are useful for formatting or combining fields, while setters are useful for de-composing a single value into multiple values for storage.","Mongoose lets you do this as well through its virtual property setters","Schemas have a few configurable options which can be passed to the constructor or set directly",
        "When running with the drivers autoReconnect option disabled and connected to a single mongod (non-replica-set), mongoose buffers commands when the connection goes down until you manually reconnect. To disable mongoose buffering under these conditions, set this option to false.","Mongoose supports MongoDBs capped collections. To specify the underlying MongoDB collection be capped, set the capped option to the maximum size of the collection in bytes.","The capped option may also be set to an object if you want to pass additional options like max or autoIndexId.

If you don't want an id getter added to your schema, you may disable it passing this option at schema construction time.", "Mongoose assigns each of your schemas an _id field by default if one is not passed into the Schema constructor. The type assigned is an ObjectId to coincide with MongoDBs default behavior.

It will then store empty objects.", "Allows setting query#read options at the schema level, providing us a way to apply default ReadPreferences to all queries derived from a model.",
        "This option is passed to MongoDB with all operations and specifies if errors should be returned to our callbacks as well as tune write behavior.", "By default this is set to true for all schemas which guarentees that any occurring error gets passed back to our callback. By setting safe to something else like { j: 1, w: 2, wtimeout: 10000 } we can guarantee the write was committed to the MongoDB journal (j: 1), at least 2 replicas (w: 2), and that the write will timeout if it takes longer than 10 seconds (wtimeout: 10000). Errors will still be passed to our callback.", "The shardKey option is used when we have a sharded MongoDB architecture. Each sharded collection is given a shard key which must be present in all insert/update operations. We just need to set this schema option to the same shard key and we’ll be all set.", "The strict option, (enabled by default), ensures that values passed to our model constructor that were not specified in our schema do not get saved to the db.", "Documents have a toObject method which converts the mongoose document into a plain javascript object. This method accepts a few options. Instead of applying these options on a per-document basis we may declare the options here and have it applied to all of this schemas documents by default.",

This is to prevent saving an invalid document. If you want to handle validation manually, and be able to save objects which don't pass validation, you can set validateBeforeSave to false.", "The versionKey is a property set on each document when first created by Mongoose.

Documents can be retreived using each models find, findById, findOne, or where static methods.","Models have a static remove method available for removing all documents matching conditions.", "Each model has its own update method for modifying documents in the database without returning them to your application. See the API docs for more detail.", "If you want to update a single document in the db and return it to your application, use findOneAndUpdate instead.", "Mongoose documents represent a one-to-one mapping to documents as stored in MongoDB. Each document is an instance of its Model.", "There are many ways to retrieve documents from MongoDB. We won't cover that in this section. See the chapter on querying for detail.",
        "Documents are validated before they are saved. Read the api docs or the validation chapter for detail.", "Sub-documents enjoy all the same features as normal documents. The only difference is that they are not saved individually, they are saved whenever their top-level parent document is saved.", "If an error occurs in a sub-documents' middleware, it is bubbled up to the save() callback of the parent, so error handling is a snap!", "Each document has an _id. DocumentArrays have a special id method for looking up a document by its _id.", "Sub-docs may also be created without adding them to the array by using the create method of MongooseArrays.", "You can also embed schemas without using arrays.", "A single embedded sub-document behaves similarly to an embedded array. It only gets saved when the parent document gets saved, and its pre/post document middleware get executed.", "When executing a query with a callback function, you specify your query as a JSON document. The JSON document's syntax is the same as the MongoDB shell.",
        "In the above code, the query variable is of type Query. A Query enables you to build up a query using chaining syntax, rather than specifying a JSON object. The below 2 examples are equivalent.", "Queries can be streamed from MongoDB to your application as well. Simply call the query's stream method instead of exec to return an instance of QueryStream. Note: QueryStreams are Node.js 0.8 style read streams not Node.js 0.10 style.","If the built-in validators aren't enough, validation can be completely tailored to suite your needs.", "Mongoose documents also have a validateSync() function, which returns a ValidationError if there was an error, or falsy if there was no error. Note that validateSync() only executes synchronous validators. Custom asynchronous validators won't execute.", "In the above examples, you learned about document validation. Mongoose also supports validation for update() and findOneAndUpdate() operations. In Mongoose 4.x, update validators are off by default - you need to specify the runValidators option.", "There are a couple of key differences between update validators and document validators. In the color validation function above, this refers to the document being validated when using document validation.",
        "When using update validators, required validators only fail when you try to explicitly $unset the key.", "Middleware (also called pre and post hooks) are functions which are passed control during execution of asynchronous functions. Middleware is specified on the schema level and is useful for writing plugins. Mongoose 4.0 has 2 types of middleware: document middleware and query middleware", "There are two types of pre hooks, serial and parallel.", "If any middleware calls next or done with an error, the flow is interrupted, and the error is passed to the callback.","Query middleware differs from document middleware in a subtle but important way: in document middleware, this refers to the document being updated. In query middleware, mongoose doesn't necessarily have a reference to the document being updated, so this refers to the query object rather than the document being updated.","There are no joins in MongoDB but sometimes we still want references to documents in other collections. This is where population comes in.", "Populated paths are no longer set to their original _id , their value is replaced with the mongoose document returned from the database by performing a separate query before returning the results.",
        "The connect method also accepts an options object which will be passed on to the underlying driver. All options included here take precedence over options passed in the connection string.", "Each connection, whether created with mongoose.connect or mongoose.createConnection are all backed by an internal configurable connection pool defaulting to a size of 5.", "Schemas are pluggable, that is, they allow for applying pre-packaged capabilities to extend their functionality.", "We just added last-modified behavior to both our Game and Player schemas and declared an index on the lastMod path of our Games to boot. Not bad for a few lines of code.", "Mongoose async operations, like .save() and queries, return Promises/A+ conformant promises.", "Mongoose queries are not promises. However, they do have a .then() function for yield and async/await. If you need a fully-fledged promise, use the .exec() function."]
